            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Every movement begins with an idea—a spark that ignites change. For Streams of Purpose, that spark was Andrew Otieno, who envisioned a world where healthcare, dignity, and opportunity flowed freely, without barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having worked in public health and seen firsthand the inequities in medical access, Andrew recognized that underserved communities didn’t just need aid; they needed long-term solutions, empowerment, and sustainable outreach. He knew this mission couldn’t be carried alone, so he shared the vision with two friends who shared his passion—Silvester Okoth and Karen Wangeci.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, they transformed an idea into action. What started as conversations about health disparities and community struggles soon became a fully realized initiative—Streams of Purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with small health camps, they organized mobile clinics, health education programs, and support initiatives, pulling in volunteers and building partnerships that could amplify their impact. Andrew, now serving as the National Officer for SCOPH, continues to guide the organization alongside Silvester and Karen, ensuring that the vision remains strong and the mission continues to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                What began as an idea shared among friends has now become a movement, proving that when purpose meets action, change is inevitable.

                    <h3>Medical Outreach</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our medical outreach program brings vital healthcare services to remote and marginalized areas. We conduct regular medical camps, offer mobile clinics, and provide free health screenings for conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and more. Our dedicated team of volunteers and health professionals ensure that those who need care most receive it with dignity and respect.

                    <h3>Health Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        We believe that knowledge is power. Through workshops, school visits, and community forums, we educate people on important health topics including hygiene, nutrition, maternal and child health, mental health, and prevention of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Our goal is to inspire informed choices for healthier lives.

                    <p>
                        Streams of Purpose is committed to supporting the most vulnerable. We distribute food packages, hygiene kits, clothing, and educational materials to orphans, the elderly, people with disabilities, and street families. Our support programs are designed not only to provide relief but also to restore hope and dignity in every individual we reach.
